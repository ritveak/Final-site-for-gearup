# SITE-FOR-GEAR-UP
I made this front end for a company "Gear Up"which specialises in preplacement training and resume building.I guess you people can make use of it as a template too.

It is a single page, responsive web page.
It is my first project and I accept that it is very haphazard. It might also be tough to understand it due to lack of interactive comments....
But if I get time I will repair those.

I have used both Bootstrap and w3 CSS (which I know could have been avoided by using only one of them.)
I have also used jQuery Smooth for smooth scrolling.
There might be some links or script which are of no use (because the file has gone many changes and removal of features.) For eg the AOS library (animate on scroll) is of no use because I had to remove animations.

But with time I will try to overcome these things....
(By the way i should start with removing aos library)

BYE !!!
